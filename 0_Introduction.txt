C++ Overview

C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that 
supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the 
C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.

C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.

Note − A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed during compile-time 
as opposed to run-time.


Object-Oriented Programming

C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development −

Encapsulation
Data hiding
Inheritance
Polymorphism
